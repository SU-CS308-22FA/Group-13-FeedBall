<h3 id="obtaining-the-source-code">Obtaining the Source Code</h3>
<p>We use the same document for both the backend and the frontend of the web app, and this said code could be found within our GitHub Repository. </p>
<p>There are two ways to obtain the code:</p>
<p>1- Cloning the repo using the URL that is obtained from the green “Code” button in GitHub. Then, you take the HTTPS link for the GitHub repo, and choose the directory in which you want to view the source code. Then, using git clone and the https that is obtained, you clone the repository to your local device within the directory you want. </p>
<p>2- Downloading the code as a zip file from GitHub. The code is downloaded from the green “Code” button, clicks the download ZIP. The file should then be unzipped. Then you open your chosen Integrated Development Environment and open the unzipped code file to view the source code. </p>
<h3 id="layout-of-the-directory">Layout of the Directory</h3>
<p>The directory is mostly self-explanatory. Every page that you are redirected to has its own separate folder. </p>
<p>The docs folder contains the images that are used within the code, for example the logo and the custom headers within the main page. The biggest folder is the src, which contains app, assets, and environments. </p>
<p>In the app folder, there are the pages, each having their own css, html and ts file. The models files are crucial when creating a new collection within the database. It contains every collection we’re keeping track of (matches, messages, news, polls). Shared\services are responsible for keeping track of the database implementation and sending/receiving data from our database. App-routing module is for creating paths within the web app and app.module is where we initialize our declarations and export them as necessary. </p>
<h3 id="build-and-deploy">Build and Deploy</h3>
<p>(We used Vercel to deploy our server, which uses your Git account to access the projects within. Vercel is also in sync with the project, meaning every change you make within the source code that you push the GitHub will automatically be deployed to Vercel as well.)</p>
<p>This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> version 14.1.2.</p>
<h4 id="development-server">Development server</h4>
<p>Run <code>ng serve</code> for a dev server. Navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200/</code>. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

<h4 id="code-scaffolding">Code scaffolding</h4>
<p>Run <code>ng generate component component-name</code> to generate a new component. You can also use <code>ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module</code>.</p>
<h4 id="build">Build</h4>
<p>Run <code>ng build</code> to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the <code>dist/</code> directory.</p>
<h4 id="running-unit-tests">Running unit tests</h4>
<p>Run <code>ng test</code> to execute the unit tests via <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a>.</p>
<h4 id="running-end-to-end-tests">Running end-to-end tests</h4>
<p>Run <code>ng e2e</code> to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.</p>
