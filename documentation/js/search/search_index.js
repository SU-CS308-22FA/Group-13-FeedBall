You need to provide clear instructions for how to obtain all sources.)\n* The layout of the directory structure. (What do folders contain and where to find source files, tests, documentation, data, etc.)\n* How to build and deploy the software. (You need to provide clear instructions for how to use your project's build system and how you deployed it to your remote system.)(not finished, will be finished
